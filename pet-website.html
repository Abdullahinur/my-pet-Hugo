    <h2><strong>Why Hugo is the best dog</strong></h2>
    <p><em>"Why would he be the best you ask?"</em> Simply put, never have i ever
    seen or come across a dog that would rather go sleep behind the front
  door when visitors arrive. Or pees in and on every concivable location or item
within the vicinity. After that you still find yourself asking why? Well...
Nothing beats a best friend who'll always be the for you, regardless of
what they want.</p>
